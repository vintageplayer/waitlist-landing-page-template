# Waitlist Landing Page

If you are looking for a simple and effective waitlist page, this is the right place. Fork it and start using it :)

[Demo](https://waitlist-landing-page.vercel.app/)

## For Using
- First of all, you need to change `src/config/general.ts` to yours.
- If you want to play with color then you can take a look at `tailwind.config.ts`.
- You need to create an embedded-form on MailerLite. Then you can use the form.
- We have some images and you can change them in the `public` folder.
- Don't forget to change the footer. I put some dummy data on it.

## Updating the content
- You can easily use ChatGPT to write the content and update the config file. [Sample prompt](https://chatgpt.com/share/677bfe7b-fa00-8006-b278-a1405d9b33da).
- Use [unsplash]() to download the hero images. This can be automated using their [API](https://chatgpt.com/share/677bfe7b-fa00-8006-b278-a1405d9b33da). I found the top hits to be the best ones. I ended up downloading the best 2 manually.
- There are other stock image websites (with APIs too): [https://shotstack.io/learn/best-stock-image-video-apis/](https://shotstack.io/learn/best-stock-image-video-apis/)
- For logo, you can use an SVG generator with options for custom font
